/*
TC != time taken
-->Rate at which the time increases with respect to the input size.

1. worst case senario
2. avoid constant
3. avoid lower value
Big Oh Notation--> O()

Space Complexity 
    = Auxilary Space (space you take to solve the problem)
    + Input Space (space you take to store the input)

a = a + b; X donn't manipulate the data/ never ever temper with the data
